# Cheems Route üêæ

Join me in this platzi course where i get to learn how to use react routes.

## Please don't clone this

As it is a repository full with inside jokes and self-explanations that goes on and on no sense and also they're in spanish

Either way you want to clone it this are the available scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### You might also find a  `npm run eject`

**But I personally don't recomend it**, mainly because I don't know how it works, and for what i read, it leaves you alone with the building.
